Python implementation of the Syntax Analyzer for the "Jack" language.

[Project 10 of Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project10)

Tested with `python jackanalyzer.py DirectoryName` and then using the provided TextComparer to compare each produced file `%.xml` in that folder with the `%-correct.xml` which is provided in the project. Passed tests for DirectoryName = ArrayTest, ExpressionLessSquare and Square, which were the three tests provided in the project.
